_Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc._

_Example: The Electron team will send a response indicating the next steps in 
handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team 
will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and 
may ask for additional information or guidance._

_Example from ossf/scorecard: Our vulnerability management team will respond within 3 working days of your email. If the issue is confirmed as a vulnerability, we will open a Security Advisory and acknowledge your contributions as part of it. This project follows a 90 day disclosure timeline._
