## Welcome to the SignServer Community

SignServer is a signing solution for digitally signing code, documents, and artifacts while keeping signing keys secure and signing workflows auditable. It is platform-independent and supports centralized, policy-driven signing operations. 

SignServer is developed in Java and runs on a JVM such as OpenJDK, available on most platforms, such as Linux and Windows. 

There are two versions of SignServer: 

*  **[SignServer Community](https://www.signserver.org/)** (SignServer CE)

SignServer Community Edition is an LGPL-licensed open-source subset of SignServer Enterprise, certified by the Open Source Initiative, and designed for learning, testing, and prototyping signing workflows for code, documents, and artifacts. 

SignServer CE is not intended for production use, as production signing environments typically require security certifications, advanced key protection, auditability, SLAs, support, and operational assurances available in SignServer Enterprise. 

*  **[SignServer Enterprise](https://www.keyfactor.com/products/signserver-enterprise/)** (SignServer EE)

SignServer Enterprise Edition is designed for production signing environments, offering advanced signing features, enterprise-grade key management, auditability, compliance capabilities, and commercial support with SLAs. 

Learn more about the differences between SignServer CE and SignServer EE: [SignServer Community vs Enterprise](https://www.signserver.org/community-vs-enterprise/)
